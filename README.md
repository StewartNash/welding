# Welding
This is an educational repository for neural network development. 

## Introduction
We will develop a neural network that approximates the results of welding given specific input variables. We will then use an optimization algorithm operating over inputs and outputs of the neural network to find the best settings. We will generate sample information using arbitrary functions, and the data is not necessarily reflective of actual or real data. The input variables are as follows:

* electrode force
* electrode contact surface diameter
* squeeze time
* weld time
* hold time
* weld current

The output variabels are as follows:

* leak rate
* explosive force
* leaking
* explosion

Leaking and explosion are binary categories whereas leak rate and explosive force, respectively, provide a quantitative measure of these.
