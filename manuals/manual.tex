\title{Welding: Using Artifical Neural Networks}
\author{Stewart Nash}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This white paper covers the generation of artificial neural networks to set optimal welding parameters. Specifically, it explains the welding repository located at https://github.com/StewartNash/welding and covers theory in-depth at a level which cannot be accomodated by the readme on the main page.

\section{Introduction}
  Artificial neural networks can be used to model the performance of welding when trained on the results of welding.
